				<h2>What is high-powered rocketry?</h2>
				<p>High powered rockets have the capacity to travel miles up into the atmosphere, and must be engineered and built to survive the harsh aerodynamic, inertial, and internal propulsive loads required to launch rockets to these extreme altitudes. It requires complex, well-designed remote operated control systems, radio-based telemetry, reliable and robust recovery systems, and a great team of rocket scientists and supersonic fluids analysts to hit our desired flight trajectories.</p>
